## Detailed Notes on K8s Security with Kyverno

### Introduction

Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes, allowing users to enforce, validate, and mutate configurations dynamically without writing custom admission controllers. It simplifies the process of managing Kubernetes security and governance, making it easier for DevOps engineers to maintain compliance and security standards within their clusters.

### Problem Statement

#### Governance and Compliance in Kubernetes

In a large organization with multiple development teams, maintaining compliance and governance in Kubernetes clusters can be challenging. Each team may have different namespaces and deploy various microservices, leading to potential security and resource management issues. Traditional methods using custom admission controllers are cumbersome and not scalable.

**Example Problem:**
- Ensuring all pods have resource requests and limits to prevent a single pod from consuming all resources and affecting other pods.

### Kyverno Overview

Kyverno simplifies Kubernetes governance by allowing policies to be defined in YAML, which are then dynamically enforced by Kyverno's admission controller. (it's setup is somewhat similiar to Istio, deployed centrally in seprate namespace 'Kyverno' where the webhookservice is running as pods which is invoked by dynamic admission controller)

#### Key Features of Kyverno:
1. **Generate:** Automatically generate resources.
2. **Validate:** Validate configurations against policies.
3. **Mutate:** Modify configurations to match policies.
4. **Verify Images:** Ensure container images meet specified criteria.

### Setting Up Kyverno

1. **Installation:**
   ```sh
   kubectl create -f https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/releases/download/v1.11.1/install.yaml

   ```

2. **Basic Usage:**
   Define a policy in YAML to enforce specific rules. For example, ensuring all pods have resource requests and limits:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
   kind: ClusterPolicy
   metadata:
     name: require-resources
   spec:
     rules:
     - name: check-resources
       match:
         resources:
           kinds:
           - Pod
       validate:
         message: "Resource requests and limits are required"
         pattern:
           spec:
             containers:
             - resources:
                 requests:
                   memory: "?*"
                   cpu: "?*"
                 limits:
                   memory: "?*"
                   cpu: "?*"
   ```

3. **Applying the Policy:**
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f require-resources.yaml
   ```

### Advanced Usage with Argo CD

For automated governance, integrate Kyverno with Argo CD. Argo CD ensures policies are applied and updated consistently across the cluster.

#### Setting Up Argo CD:

1. **Install Argo CD:**
   ```sh
   kubectl create namespace argocd
   kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/master/manifests/install.yaml
   ```

2. **Deploying Kyverno Policies with Argo CD:**
   Define an Argo CD application for Kyverno policies:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Application
   metadata:
     name: kyverno-policies
     namespace: argocd
   spec:
     project: default
     source:
       repoURL: 'https://github.com/your-repo/kyverno-policies'
       targetRevision: HEAD
       path: policies
     destination:
       server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
       namespace: default
     syncPolicy:
       automated:
         prune: true
         selfHeal: true
   ```

3. **Syncing Policies:**
   ```sh
   argocd app sync kyverno-policies
   ```

### Example Use Cases

1. **Restricting Image Registries:**
   Ensure only images from trusted registries are used.
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
   kind: ClusterPolicy
   metadata:
     name: restrict-image-registries
   spec:
     rules:
     - name: check-image-registry
       match:
         resources:
           kinds:
           - Pod
       validate:
         message: "Images must be from 'my-registry.com'"
         pattern:
           spec:
             containers:
             - image: "my-registry.com/*"
   ```

2. **Enforcing ReadOnly Root Filesystem:**
   Ensure all containers use a read-only root filesystem.
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
   kind: ClusterPolicy
   metadata:
     name: readonly-root-filesystem
   spec:
     rules:
     - name: check-readonly-root
       match:
         resources:
           kinds:
           - Pod
       validate:
         message: "Containers must run with a read-only root filesystem"
         pattern:
           spec:
             containers:
             - securityContext:
                 readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
   ```

### Conclusion

Kyverno provides a scalable and dynamic solution for Kubernetes governance and compliance. By leveraging its powerful policy engine, DevOps engineers can ensure their clusters adhere to organizational standards without the overhead of writing custom admission controllers. Integrating Kyverno with tools like Argo CD further automates and simplifies the management process.
